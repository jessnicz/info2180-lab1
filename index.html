 <h2>Jessica Whyte</h2>
 <p>I am a second-year computing student from the Faculty of Science and Technology. My knack for problem-solving and my infinite curiosity have guided me onto the path of reading for a bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology. I am a creative who does digital art in my very limited spare time and appreciates all forms of art. Upon completion of my degree programme, I hope to have gained the knowledge and competence to fulfill a role as an IT consultant or a cyber security specialist.  </p>
